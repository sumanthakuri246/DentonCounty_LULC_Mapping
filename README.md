# Denton County LULC Mapping Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive study on Land Use Land Cover (LULC) mapping in Denton County, Texas. Leveraging Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Jupyter Notebook, the project focuses on utilizing National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) data for creating a detailed LULC map.

## Key Features

- **Data Sources:** National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) data
- **Technologies Used:** Google Earth Engine, Jupyter Notebook, Python (ee and geemap libraries)
- **Algorithm:** Support Vector Machine (SVM) for image classification

## Project Highlights

- Efficient cloud-based computation using GEE for handling large datasets.
- Effective utilization of the SVM algorithm to delineate diverse land cover types.
- Denton County's varied landscape, including residential areas, open spaces, forests, and water bodies, serves as an ideal study area.
- Showcase of the power of remote sensing techniques for monitoring and mapping LULC changes in a rapidly evolving region.
- Integration of GEE and Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive and efficient approach for researchers and practitioners.

## Limitations and Future Work

- The classification results present certain limitations, including misclassifications and feature omissions.
- Future work may explore more advanced classification methods, such as neural networks and integrated approaches.

## Getting Started

To explore the code and reproduce the results, follow the steps in the [Jupyter Notebook](LULC_SVM.ipynb).
